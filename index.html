                <p>In our daily life, there are lots of movies released around the world every day.</p>
                <p>However, it is hard to know if it of high quality or low quality unless it has been released for a long time.</p>
                <p>But watching the excellent movies the first time can be the best experience.</p>
                <p>In this data story, it analyzes 5000 movies data from IMDB and then gives some common features of high score English movies
                    that released between 2010-2016, which may help people to predict the quality of new movies before releasing.

                    Think about the movies you watched recent years, you will find that although more and more movies are produced in a year,
                    it is harder to find a movie with high quality.
                    The line chart on your left hand shows the average IMDB score of movies from 1916 to 2016.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                   It is clear that the average score slightly decreased within these years.
                    This indicates that the quality of the movies is declining year by year
                    or the audience is becoming more and more strict with the quality.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Based on this, no matter which reason is right, it is helpful to conclude some common features of high-quality movies.

                        Fortunately, after calculating the linear regression equation of each genre,
                        there is a relatively strong positive linear relationship between budget and IMDB score of ACTION movies(The p-value of the trend line is 0.02).
